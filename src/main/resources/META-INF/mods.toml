Magical Metals Mod.

Basically adds in rods that bestow potion effects on people. Theoretically going to be expanded in the future.

This mod was created as part of the Desert Bus Game Jam 2020. This game jam ran during Desert Bus for Hope 2020, a charity drive stream for Childs Play.

Some parts inspired by the Botania Mod by Vazkii.

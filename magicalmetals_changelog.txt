Magical Metals Changelog

== Version 1.2 ==
For Forge 35.1.0
For Minecraft 1.16.4

	Added:
		Changelog
		New functional block - Butterfly Boxes
			These boxes create the Butterfly entity, which wanders around near it's home and grows trees, or crops, or converts dirt to grass.
			Entity has a lifetime of 5 minutes, and the box is a TileEntity which checks to create a new butterfly every minute.
			The butterflys will die if they don't have a home - so if you manually spawn one it won't work, but this means they will die after the server starts up again. This is intentional.
			
			All these use green iron to produce.
		New Recipe
			Can create grass from dirt using green iron.
		Book alterations
			Text in the book has been altered slightly, to make it slighly more readable.
			Now includes a brief "Getting Started" section to aid beginning.
			Pages are read by default.
		Fixes
			BreakingBlock's tile entity is now created correctly.
